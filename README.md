## Detailed Description

Willman Programming is developing a powerful inventory management and e-commerce software tailored for automotive sales businesses. This system will streamline both the customer shopping experience and back-end management by providing a seamless, role-based interface. A secure login system will grant access to either the Customer Page or the Manager Page, ensuring that each user interacts only with the features relevant to their role. Customers will be able to browse a catalog of cars and customizable packages, add items to a shopping cart, and prepare for purchase. The shopping interface will be intuitive, visually engaging, and optimized for ease of use.

On the Manager Page, administrators will have access to tools for managing customer accounts, creating promotional discounts, placing orders on behalf of customers, and overseeing inventory with real-time updates. The system will be built with scalability, security, and automation in mind, ensuring accurate data tracking and smooth operations. By modernizing how automotive businesses handle sales and inventory, this software will provide a fast, reliable, and user-friendly solution that enhances both customer engagement and operational efficiency.
